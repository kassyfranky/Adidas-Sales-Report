# Adidas-Sales-Report

## Project Overview

Creating an Adidas sales report project overview on Excel involves organizing and analyzing sales data to gain insights into Adidas's performance. I used Excel's functionalities like pivot tables, charts, and formulas to summarize sales figures, track trends, and visualize sales data effectively. By inputting and manipulating sales data in Excel, I was able to generate comprehensive reports showcasing Adidas's sales performance over time, regional sales distribution, product performance analysis, and more. Excel's versatility allows for in-depth analysis and presentation of the sales report project overview for Adidas.
